# Seyyah

Welcome to Seyyah, a Ruby gem for those who wish to learn more about the world. Seyyah actually means 'Traveler' in Turkish. 

This gem will provide you with a list of regions that encompass countries across the world and the user will make a selection based on the region they wish to learn more about. Once you select the region, you will get a description of that region and the 10 most popular countries in the region. 

From the 10 most popular countries, you will be able to see the description of the country and the 10 most popular cities in that country. 

The gem will be further updated to provide information related to all the countries in each region. ~ Version 2 Pending
